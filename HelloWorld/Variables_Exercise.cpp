	//You can not print to the console unless the problem specifies.

	//1. Select suitable variable types and names for the following examples
	//a) The average height of students in your class
	int avgStudentHeight_Class = 66;
	//b) The tax rate for incomes over $65000
	float taxRate_Over = 65000;
	//c) The tax rate for incomes below $5000
	float taxRate_Below = 5000;
	//d) The total cost of all the games on your Steam library
	int ttlCostOfSteamLibrary = 300;

	//2. Select suitable data types to hold the following values :
	//a) 121
	int;
	//b) 9.4
	float;
	//c) r
	char;
	//d) 100000
	int;
	//e) False
	bool;

	//3. Create a program that swaps two numbers. Ask the user for 2 numbers in the console window
	//and store the result in variables called “a” and “b” print the result to screen.Write code 
	//that swaps the values for these variables, then print the variables “a” and “b” again.
	//You should comment your code.

#include <iostream>

	int main()

		int input;
	std::cout << "Enter number\n";
	std::cin >> input; 

	//4. Ask the user for 5 numbers and output the average of these numbers.		

	//5. Redo question 3 but allows the user to input the values to be swapped and provide information
	//in the console proving the data was swapped.
